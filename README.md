# Backlog

- [] Exercise CRUD functionality

## Nice to have

- [] if the workout for the day already exists, show message to the user and open that workout
- [] deleting a workout should be with a confirm dialog
- [] edit a workout when in a list -> with a modal
- [] add click away listener for calendar

## Ideas

- [] A component that display a set of days as days of the week. For example, display last 3 days or next 3 days and so on based on props - since I'm not sure yet. Definitely want to have upcoming workout, but I want it to be different than workout, but not sure how yet.


## Ready for Work
- [] it would be nice to have 3 or more types of updating a workoutset, since I'm not sure which one would be the most fun to update.
    - already and input that doesn't look like one, but when the user clicks, is able to types
        Plus - already implemented, so should be easy
        Minus - not sure if I have enought space
    - modal
        Plus - intuitive and less prone to error
        Minus - annoying to implement
    - button icons
        Plus - doesn't require typing
        Minus - not sure about the UI. Should it be editable all the time or on click? (No hover since it has to work on mobile also)
