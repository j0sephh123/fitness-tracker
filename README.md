# Tasks Board

## Nice to have

- [] if the workout for the day already exists, show message to the user and open that workout
- [] deleting a workout should be with a confirm dialog
- [] edit a workout when in a list -> with a modal
- [] add click away listener for calendar

## Ideas
- [] A component that display a set of days as days of the week. For example, display last 3 days or next 3 days and so on based on props - since I'm not sure yet. Definitely want to have upcoming workout, but I want it to be different than workout, but not sure how yet.
## Ready for Work
- [] Exercise CRUD functionality
## In Progress
